# C++ Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains a movie recommendation system implemented in C++. It is a project I chose to make for my CS32 (Data Structures and Algorithms) class at UCLA. It utilizes two main data files: `users.txt`, which contains user data and information about the movies they have watched, and `movies.txt`, which contains details about the movies, including actors, directors, ratings, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this C++ movie recommendation system, follow these steps:
1. See the users.txt and identify which user you want recommendations for.
2. If you want to get custom movie recommendations then make the necessary changes in users.txt and movies.txt
3. Run the main and edit the email field and the number of recommendations you want. Default at "KabiL@aol.com" and 8 recommendations.

## Data Files

### 1. `movies.txt`

This file contains data and information about the movies. Each line in the file represents a movie and its information in the following format:

```
movie_id, name, year, Director, Actors, Genre, Rating
```

- `movie_id`: Unique identifier for the movie.
- `name`: Movie Name
- `Director`: Movie's Director
- `Actors`: Actor's Cast
- `Genre`: Movie's Genre
- `rating`: User's rating for the movie (on a scale of 1 to 5).

Example:

```

Santosh Subramaniam

M. Raja
Jayam Ravi,Genelia D'Souza,Prakash Raj,Sayaji Shinde,Geetha
Action,Comedy,Romance

```

### 2. `users.txt`

This file contains user data and information about the movies they have watched. Each line in the file represents a user and their movie preferences in the following format:

```
Name, Email, Number of Movies Watched, Movie IDs
```

- `movie_id`: Unique identifier for the movie.
- `name`: Name of person
- `email`: Email ID
- `Movie ID`: Multiple Rows of Movie IDs
